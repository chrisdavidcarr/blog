I'm a LLM developer and data professional based in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Like the majority of data scientists, I write code in Python. That being said, I also have an interest in building with low-code tools (particularly [n8n](https://n8n.io/creators/chriscarr)). I'm currently building a data analytics startup called Opinii.

I'm also available for n8n projects (contact me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/chrisdavidcarr)).
